This was work done for the Advanced Flow Diagnostics Laboratory. I worked in the lab on the GUI and cameras for about a month.
This was a totally new venture for me and I enjoyed it a lot. I had limited experience with MATLAB and none with Raspberry Pis 
but I think the GUI and pi work ended up relatively good.
